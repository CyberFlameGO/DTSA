Each will provide a second chance in case they areinadvertently pressed.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AR">Add Work to Results </A></H2><P>   Adds the spectrum in WORK to the spectrum in RESULTS, non-destructively.This capability is useful primarily in making up a set of referencesfrom a collection of spectra. It is possible to cull through thecollection looking for those spectra that have high concentrationsof the element of interest. These spectra can then be summed togetherto give one spectrum with the good counting statistics requiredwhen making references. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AP">Add Poiss&oacute;n Noise to Work</A></H2><P>   Adds true counting noise to the spectrum in WORK and placesthe resulting spectrum into RESULTS. This item puts the appropriatenoise on a spectrum generated from first principles.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="BE">Measure Beam Energy</A></H2><P>   Enter the approximate beam energy and click OK. After the fitis complete, a window with the results is displayed. You may installthis as the beam energy.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Meas_Beam_D.gif HEIGHT=354 Width=582><P> This feature is primarily useful in the scanning electron microscopeor electron probe microanalyzer to give a good measure of theexact beam energy required for quantitative electron probe microanalysis.It occurs in all parts of the ZAF-type matrix correction procedure,as well as in all of the other matrix correction procedures. Fora detailed discussion of the underlying physics and mathematicsused in this procedure see <A href="APPENDIX.html#A6"> Appendix VI</A>.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="WD">Convert WDS Scan to Energy Scale</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/WDS_EDS_D.gif HEIGHT=378 Width=623><P>    This feature will convert a wavelength dispersive scan ofa spectral region from dimensions of length, or angle, to thoseof energy. It is necessary to know the begin and end channel numbersand their associated values. It will probably be necessary toexperiment with the eV/Channel value. Keep in mind that this operationwill move the resulting spectral fragment into a very differentpart of the display and it will probably be necessary to use thefull 8192 channel capability until you have the desired result.This dialog requires some planning since just &quot;playing around&quot;here will produce quite unexpected results that often will beoutside of the display range. The conversion is exact and maintainsthe correct intensity across the spectral segment. Data may beentered as wavelength, sin q , or millimeters and the correctcrystal must be selected. Also, if the peaks are not first order,the diffraction order must be selected.<P>    The advantages of converting a WDS scan to an energy scaleis that many of the mathematical operators in DTSA can then beused directly. It is difficult to obtain a response curve fora WDS spectrometer. For those calculations in DTSA that requirea response curve we assume unit efficiency, which is sufficientfor most purposes.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SM">Smooth</A></H2>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/smooth.gif HEIGHT=148 Width=317><P>This dialog permits &quot;smoothing&quot; a spectrum with eithera 5, 7, or 9 point Savitzky-Golay polynomial. Smoothing shouldbe used with care. Gaussian Convolve will formally convolve thespectrum with the instrumental response function of the detectorelectronics. Set the resolution (FWHM at Mn Ka ) using the <A HREF="Headers.html#EH"> EXPERIMENTHEADER</A> Dialog. For the numerical weights used in the smooth, seecomments for the same operators in the <A href="Main_Control.html#CC">Calculator</A>.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DF">Digital Filter</A></H2>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/dig_filt.gif HEIGHT=240 Width=460><P> When the &quot;OK&quot; button is pushed, the digital filterwill be applied to the spectrum in  Work and the filtered spectrumwill be placed in Results. It should be noted that this digitalfilter is distinct from the digital filters used in the curvefitting operations ( Simplex and LLSQ) that have their own filterswithout user changeable parameters. For a detailed discussionof the theory of the digital filter see <A href="APPENDIX.html#A0"> Appendix X</A>.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="BS">Background Subtract</A></H2>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/BG_subt.gif HEIGHT=380 Width=638><P>Background subtract is used for a number of purposes.  The twomost important reasons to remove the background from a spectrumare in the making of &quot;Reference&quot; spectra for the linearleast squares curve fitting operation, and as a diagnostic indetermining problems in an EDS system. Each of these two reasonsrequire the subtract feature to be run with a different emphasis.<P>The Background Subtract operation works as follows: Two or more&quot;Background ROI's (regions of interest)&quot; are requiredto be judiciously Set-up in peak and artifact free regions ofthe spectrum for which it is desired to remove the background.Alternatively, there is an &quot;Auto ROI&quot; mode that willautomatically select background regions and do the fitting tothose regions. This spectrum must be in &quot;Work&quot; and the&quot;subtracted&quot; spectrum will be placed in Results. Itis then required that the user enter the composition of the specimenfrom which the spectrum was made and the kilovoltage used forthe acquisition. Furthermore, the information concerning the detectorparameters such as window thickness' should be currently valid.DTSA will then calculate a spectrum shape and scale it to thespectrum in &quot;Work&quot;. The information required for scalingis obtained from the ROI's. The size of the ROI is not used inthe scaling operation and each ROI has the same &quot;weight&quot;as any other ROI. DTSA will then subtract this generated and scaledspectrum from the spectrum in &quot;Work&quot;. Since the generatedspectrum is scaled to the actual spectrum, there is no need tospecify quantities such as Faraday  current, or acquisition time.<P>When the spectra originate from thin specimens in an analyticalelectron microscope, the exact chemical composition of the specimenis not important. Indeed, only a guess at the average atomic numberwill suffice and it is not even necessary to enter the actualelements in the specimen.<P>    However, when the spectra originate from bulk specimens ina scanning electron microscope or electron probe microanalyzer,the exact composition is important to know. This is true becausebulk targets differentially absorb their own radiation and theconstituent elements can cause large absorption edges to appearin a spectrum. To calculate these edges, it is required that thecomposition be known accurately. In the SEM case it is also necessaryto know the beam energy accurately, since errors of only a fewhundred eV can result in an inadequate fit to the top half (highenergy) part  of the spectrum. The Composition Database part ofthis dialog is now operational as is described under the <A href="Generate.html#TS"> Generate Header</A>.<P>    Background Subtract Options button will allow the choice ofphysical models for the generation of the background. In bothcases for thin and bulk specimens, one of the models, the &quot;FreeQuadratic&quot;, is a second degree energy polynomial that hasextra freedom to cause a &quot;good&quot; fit over a wide energyrange. When making reference peaks for the MLLSQ procedure, thequadratic is the model of choice. The ROI's should be chosen tobe near the peak (e.g., one ROI on each side of the peak). Ifthe fit is poor, away from the peak for which a reference is beingmade, it does not matter, since it is only the peak region withwhich we are concerned. When choosing the background ROI's, itshould be remembered that incomplete charge collection can causea distortion on the low energy side of a peak, especially in the3-5 keV range. Consequently, the low energy ROI might need tobe placed asymmetrically further from the peak than the high energyROI (that can be placed quite close to the peak). For the purposesof making MLLSQ reference peaks, we wish to include any left sidepeak distortion in the reference shape. In many detectors, asan example, the left side distortion on the Ti Ka peak is almostas wide as the peak itself and can be several percent as large.The following figure demonstrates the effect for the chlorineand potassium Ka peaks.<P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/incomp_chrg.gif HEIGHT=247 Width=356><P>Background subtracted EDS spectrum of a bulk specimen of KCl salt.The background subtraction has removed the absorption jumps. Theshaded area represents the deviation caused by incomplete chargecollection and should be included in ROI of any reference peakfor MLLSQ.<P>    For the situation where we use background subtraction as adiagnostic tool, we will make the following variations on theabove theme.<P>    First we define the problem. An Energy Dispersive Spectrometeris capable of responding to radiation other than x-rays originatingfrom the interaction volume of the primary electron beam and thespecimen. The detector is also sensitive to backscattered electronsfrom the specimen or other scattered electrons in the specimenchamber. In fact, scattered beam electrons behave very much likea gas in the specimen chamber. Any electron more energetic than25 keV will penetrate the usual 7.6 mm Beryllium window (losingsome 20-25 keV in energy due to inelastic interaction with thewindow) and create electron-hole pairs just as efficiently asan x-ray of the same energy as the electron. For the analyticalelectron microscope it is frequently the case that electrons willscatter onto the support grid (often copper) and cause both characteristicand continuum x-rays to be generated in this semi-bulk material.<P>    The resulting spectrum that we observe is the summation ofthe spectrum from the specimen volume excited by the primary electronbeam (and is the only spectrum we wish to see) and the other &quot;spectra&quot;from scattered electrons and  spurious x-rays.<P>The background subtraction process involves the creation fromfirst principles of an x-ray spectrum that has been tailored toyour particular instrumental configuration. If such a spectrumis then scaled to, and subtracted from, a real spectrum from yourinstrument, then any deviations in the shape of the residual backgroundis a clear indication that either the parameters that you enteredinto DTSA are not valid, or there is a problem, as just discussed,with stray radiation entering the detector. <P>    Since we desire, in this application of background subtraction,to study deviations of our real background to a theoreticallycalculated one, we do not want to utilize the quadratic model,discussed above. We instead want to use a model that will imposea &quot;shape&quot; across the entire spectrum with only the amplitudeas a fitting variable. Any of the other models in the &quot;Option&quot;sub-menu will accomplish this type of fit. However, it is bestfor the beginner to use only the &quot;Small&quot; model, forbulk specimens, or the MBH (modified Bethe-Heitler) model forthin specimens in the AEM. <P>By using some &quot;common sense&quot; physics, it is then possibleto pin point the problem exactly, and, hopefully, correct it.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SE">Strip Escape Peaks </A></H2><P>   This selection will strip the escape peaks from a spectrumand place the stripped spectrum in RESULTS. The calculation takesinto account the tilt of the detector. The fitting proceduresautomatically do this so it is not necessary to strip escapesbefore doing peak fitting.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DR">Detector Response into RESULTS</A></H2> <P>   Puts, into results, the current detector response curve usedby DTSA. This is useful for a quick determination of the detectorefficiency at any given photon energy.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="RW">Replace Detector Response by WORK</A></H2> <P>   Copies whatever is in WORK into the detector response. Thiswill now be used as the detector response so be sure you knowwhat is in here. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CR">Calculate Response NOW (from WORK header) </A></H2><P>   Calculates the detector response immediately from the datastored in the current WORK header. Whatever was in detector responsewill be replaced by the new calculation.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="XD">X Ray Database </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Per_Tab.gif HEIGHT=253 Width=472><P>Clicking on an element results in the appearance of another dialogthat accesses all the characteristic lines, excitation edges,satellite transitions and relative transition probabilities forthat element. The data can be presented in energy, for the EDScase, or in any of the standard WDS crystal diffraction casesfor several WDS spectrometers from different manufacturers.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/X-ray_Data.gif HEIGHT=383 Width=640><P>You may also enter an energy in eV of an x-ray line and clickthe &quot;Lookup&quot; button to see a list of all the x-ray linesclose to the energy entered. This is useful when searching forinterferences. The list may be scrolled up or down with the &quot;Up10 Lines&quot; and &quot;Down 10 Lines&quot; buttons.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
