With any selection you are requestedto supply the name of the file to convert and a name for the DTSAFile. Some of the foreign files do not supply any or all of theinformation that can be stored in the DTSA File Headers. You maycomplete the Header information in the DTSA File as describedin the section under Headers. Be sure to check the detector specificationsfor these files as that information is usually not passed in thefile header.<P><B>NOTE!!!</B> Since any number of files (spectra) may be stored in oneDTSA file, <B>be sure to name the receiving DTSA file FIRST</B>. Thenwe ask the user to find and open the ASCII file(s) to be converted.You can then add all the desired ASCII spectra to the DTSA binaryfile. All spectra in a DTSA file MUST be at the SAME BEAM VOLTAGE.After all files are processed, you can view them by clicking throughthe file by use of the file control arrows just below the KLMmarkers in the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW. If a spectrum has been inadvertentlyincluded, or there is some other reason to want it removed, thenthis can be done in the <A HREF="Headers.html#SH"> Spectrum Headers Menu Item</a>.<P> Read ASCII Column: Converts a single ASCII file in which thespectrum counts are stored in simple column format with no headerinformation. The column can be any length up to 8192 entries eitherin a single column or in multiple columns. The allowed delimitersare a space, a tab or a CR. DO NOT include a column of energiesor channel numbers.<P>All of the currently available Plug-ins are included. If you havea different format, please contact us. Most of the formats areASCII as these are the easiest to convert. <P> <A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="SS">Save Spectra as Spreadsheet</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/save_spec.gif HEIGHT=253 Width=447> <P>    This menu item brings up a dialog that allows the conversionof display spectra to an ASCII file in a format accessible byfour commercial programs. Either only the spectrum in WORK orall displayed spectra can be written to the ASCII file with eachselected spectrum in one column of the file. All the files havethe same tab delimited format, but DTSA assigns the appropriatefile &quot;creator&quot; and icon to each type. This enables simply&quot;double clicking&quot; the icon to start the appropriateapplication. Most spreadsheet programs will open and read anyof the files if the spreadsheet program is started and then thefiles are opened by the program.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="SD">Save DTSA Spectrum to Disk</A></H2> <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Save_Spec_D.gif HEIGHT=202 Width=358><P>   This function operates on the &quot;Work&quot; spectrum. Whenthis selection is made, the standard Mac file-saving dialog shownabove appears. When Save is selected to exit the dialog, the ExperimentHeader information, the Spectrum Header information and  spectrumcounts are written to the DTSA File that the user has created.To supply or edit the header information, see the sections describingthe Headers under Headers in the Menu Bar. Any other spectrumin Work, with the Spectrum Header, may be appended to this fileby using the Save Work button that can be found on the left sideof the Control Window.  A file can be appended until a new DTSAFile is created using the button Save DTSA Spectrum to Disk. <P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="AS">Append Spectrum to Old DTSA File</A></H2><P>    Spectra may be appended to an old DTSA file by selecting thismenu item. It brings up the standard file open dialog to allowthe user to select the DTSA file to open for appending. This filewill then be opened in the same manner as the Save DTSA to Diskso that additional spectra may be appended by clicking the SaveWork button in the Main Control Window. Be sure that the spectrum to be savedhas the same Experiment Header information as the selected DTSA file.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="GS">Get DTSA Spectrum from Disk</A></H2><P>    This menu selection activates the Mac file selection dialog.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/read_frdisk.gif HEIGHT=199 Width=353> <P>From the list displayed, you may select an old DTSA File to open.The first spectrum in the file will be displayed in &quot;Work&quot;.To get a list of the spectra in the file, click the Scan Filebutton in the Main Control Window.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="MR">MLLSQ References</A></H2><P> These items are for creating, appending, and displaying filesof DTSA references. References are used in linear least squaresfitting of spectra to determine the areas of the families of characteristiclines. A reference is usually obtained from a spectrum with highcounts (&gt;10,000 counts in the peak area) that has been backgroundsubtracted so that the distribution of counts goes smoothly tozero on each side of the family of lines to be used as a reference. All families of lines with no overlap from another element maybe saved from Work as references. The concentrations of the elementsin the specimen from which the spectrum was obtained need notbe known. All references useful for a particular type of analysisshould be saved to one file:  a file of references for biologicalspecimens, for steels, etc.  The structure of a reference fileis similar to a spectrum file. It has an experiment headerthat is obtained from the experiment header of the spectrum ofthe first reference saved to the file, and each reference hasa header. All the references in a file must share certainexperimental parameters:  the beam energy (keV), the detectortype and resolution, and the energy increment (eV) per channel.Any reference may be copied to other reference files, but onlyone reference for each family can be saved to a file. When addinga reference to a file, the program compares the experiment headerof the spectrum to that of the reference file and flags a disparityto the user. The program also searches the file for a referencealready saved for the family, displays the old reference in RESULTS,and prompts the user to either keep or replace the old reference.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="NR">Making a New Reference File </A></H3><P>I. Calibrate your analyzer system. The references to be made willthen be valid as long as this calibration remains valid. Copper,or an iron silicate such as Fayalite are particularly good forthis purpose and may also be used for an accurate determinationof detector resolution. Edit the fitted value for detector resolutioninto the header: See <A href="Main_Control.html#SI"> Simplex </a>and <A HREF="Main_Control.html#CA"> Calibrate </A>.<P>II. Acquire a spectrum with very high counts (&gt;10,000 countsin the peak area) for the peak for which a reference is to bemade: Fill in the Header information.<P>III. Background subtract the spectrum using Background Subtractin the Math menu until the families of lines to be saved as referencesgo smoothly to zero on the low and high energy sides.  It maynot be possible to achieve this for more than one family at atime.  Rotate Wk &amp; Reslt: See <A href="Math.html#BS">Background Subtract </a>.<P>IV. Click ROI, and Peak Wipe each useable family to include afew zero count channels on both sides of a family: See <A href="Main_Control.html#RI"> ROI (Regions-of-Interest)</a>.<P>V.  Under Main Menu File, MLLSQ References  select New File. Ifthere is more than one Peak ROI set, the program flags the userto check that they are all for spectrum segments useable as references. The program then asks the user to verify that the beam energy(keV), resolution and eV per channel from the WORK Header arecorrect. If so, a dialog to name the new reference file is displayed. Supply a name and click Save.<P>VI. The Elements dialog is displayed:  check the elements forwhich there are Peak ROIs set. The WORK Experiment Header is copiedto the reference file and each reference distribution is storedwith its header information.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="DR">Displaying References </A></H3><P>I. Under Main Menu File, MLLSQ References  select Display Ref. The file selection dialog is displayed:  double click the fileto be displayed or click the file then Open.  The display referencedialog is activated.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/disp_refs.gif HEIGHT=215 Width=365><P>II.  Input the family name of the reference to display in WORK,then click OK to retire the dialog. If the reference is not inthe file a message will be displayed. Or check the box to selectfrom a list of references in the file, then click OK to retirethe dialog.  A scrollable list of references in the file is displayed:double click on a selection to display the reference or clickQuit to retire the list.<P>III. Once a reference file is opened to display a reference, thearrows and buttons for Spectrum Number may be used to move throughthe file.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="AR">Appending to a  Reference File</A></H3><P>I. Prepare a spectrum as in steps I - IV under Making a NEW ReferenceFile.<P>II. Under Main Menu File, MLLSQ References  select Add Ref. Thefile selection dialog is displayed:  double click the file tobe appended to or click the file then Open.<P>III.  The experiment headers of the reference file and the spectrumfile are compared and the user is flagged and appending terminatedif there is a difference between any two of the critical experimentparameters.<P>IV. The file is searched for the family to be saved. If a referencefor the family is not in the file, the new reference is appendedto the file. If there is a reference for the family in the file,the old reference is displayed in RESULTS and a dialog promptingthe user to KEEP or REPLACE the reference is displayed. ClickOK to dismiss the dialog.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="FF">Fit Files</A></H2> <P> The options under this selection allow the user to manipulateDTSA Fit Files. Rename a File  bring up the Mac file selectiondialog to pick the file to rename and then the Mac save file dialogto input the new name. This is useful for renaming the defaultFit File that is written when the MLLSQ or Simplex fitting procedureis run and a filename has not been supplied for the results. OutputOptions brings up a dialog to create the ASCII files checked fromthe selected binary Fit File. Show Contents brings up the Macfile selection dialog and then displays an ASCII output of thebinary Fit File selected. Open to Append brings up the Mac fileselection dialog. The results of fitting a DTSA File are thenadded to the selected Fit File when Add Fit in the Main ControlWindow or Fit the File of Spectra under Analysis is selected.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="DP">DTSA Preferences </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/DTSAprefs.gif HEIGHT=124 Width=473><P>    DTSA has a great variety of options such as color schemes,choice of x-ray cross-section, take-off angle etc., which willcustomize the program to the preferences of the user(s) and theirelectron column instrument(s).  DTSA can save the values for aparticular configuration as a binary file. For example, one Preferencesfile might be for an SEM that has a take-off angle of 30 degrees.The second Preferences might be for a 200 keV AEM with a 23 degreetake-off angle. Three pre-named files called &quot;Preferences.mca&quot;,&quot;Preferences1.mca&quot;, and &quot;Preferences2.mca&quot;are provided. The first is the default file to which a configurationis saved at program termination and existing data is overwritten.The default file is automatically read by the program at start-upand the saved configuration is restored.  It should be noted thatprogram termination means that you have quit DTSA and not experienceda power failure or a program crash. &quot;Preferences1.mca&quot;and &quot;Preferences2.mca&quot;  are written or read at any timeby selecting Values to Prefs1 etc., The first two hierarchicalmenu items bring up Mac file dialogs for selecting or creatinga file of preferences with a user-supplied name.<P>The pre-named Preferences files are always written at thesame &quot;level&quot; as DTSA, that is, they are in the samefolder as DTSA.<P>   NOTE   The Preferences files save the spectrum that is in workat the time they are created. Consequently, when read, they willreplace the spectrum in work. They do not, however, open a DTSAfile; the active file remains active and can be restored to Workby using the Scan File controls. <P>  A WARNING   If you have inadvertently put a lot of extraneousvalues into the program variables by experimenting with proceduresunfamiliar to you, or you have activated a bug that did some damage,the default Preferences file, Preferences.mca, will remember thedamage and/or extraneous values and reactivate it on start up.It is always a good idea to save a Preferences file that willconfigure the program just the way you want it and working correctly.If the program seems to be broken, activate a good Preferencesfile or QUIT, throw away Preferences.mca, and start over.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="DO">Display Options</A></H2><P>    This selection displays the dialog (shown below) that is usedto choose distinctive colors for the various items in the SpectrumDisplay Window. Additionally, as an aid in printing displayedspectra to a non-color printer, it is possible to choose plottingsymbols. It should be noted that the fastest screen refreshingis done when a single pixel-Connected combination is chosen. Thecurrently active colors for each item are shown beside that item.The &quot;Set Default Colors&quot; button will reset any changedcolors to the initial colors stored in the program. Color changesmade by the user are saved in the Preferences File that is automaticallysaved when you Quit the program. The &quot;No Header on Printout&quot;check-box allows you to suppress printing the spectrum headeron a printout.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Disp_Opt_D.gif HEIGHT=376 Width=484><P> When a color choice button is pushed, the following  standardMacintosh color picker dialog will appear. The square color boxat the top left will display the active and proposed colors. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Col_Whl_D.gif HEIGHT=301 Width=512> <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="FS">Label Font Size</A></H2><P>    The font size of the peak labels may be set to a larger sizeparticularly for print-outs of spectra. Then if the printed spectrumis reduced in size, the peak labels will still be legible.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/label_sz.gif HEIGHT=168 Width=356><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="PR">Printer Set-up</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/prnt_setup.gif HEIGHT=93 Width=261><P>    Spectrum printing in the DTSA program is particularly convenientbecause it is the  Spectrum Display Window that is sent to theprinter. The printed spectrum looks like it does on the displayand so can be configured using the standard spectrum display controlsand buttons. Some selected Header information is also printedbelow the Spectrum Display Window. It is possible to suppressthe header - see <A href="#DO"> Display Options</A> above. The KLM markers may beprinted along with any peak labels.<P>    The selection Set-up Printer w/o Printing enables the userto prepare the printing configuration at any time. Clicking onthe selection displays the Macintosh LaserWriter PageSetup dialog.To print spectra with a thinner or thicker line use a &quot;Reduceor Enlarge&quot; number other than &quot;100&quot;. The plot sizewill remain the same but the &quot;pen&quot; size will change.Try numbers from 60-400. Thicker lines are useful for making viewgraphsand slides. If this dialog is accepted, the LaserWriter printingdialog is displayed. Once this dialog is accepted the printingconfiguration remains active for any spectrum printing but printingdoes not occur until one of the next two selections is chosen.Print 'Displayed' Spectra (those spectra that are selected fordisplay) causes only the current screen display to be printed.Print all Spectra in active 'DTSA' file causes each spectrum inthe DTSA File to be loaded into work and displayed and printedin turn with the same parameters as those active when the selectionis made. Since the intensity of the highest peak in each spectrummay vary through the file, the vertical scale should be carefullychosen so that each spectrum is printed in a useful way.<P>Warning!! Some laser writer print dialog windows support grayscale and color and DTSA only prints black &amp; white. This optionmust be off or the time to print will increase considerably. Atypical example of print time, for the older Laser Writer Plus,is one minute from the print request to paper delivery. DTSA shouldbecome free from the print request in 20 seconds. In all cases,printing should occur as each print request is made.<P>TIP: In the print window, you can send the print image to an EncapsulatedPostscript File instead of the printer. This file can then beimported into any document and printed as a part of the document.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
