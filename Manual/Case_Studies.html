The Si(Li) detectoris capable of responding to an energetic electron that entersthe active region of the detector. A pulse is developed, the heightof which is a measure of the energy of the electron. When thebeam electrons strike the sample, a significant fraction, about30% for copper with a beam normally incident, are backscatteredwith a wide energy range. Many of these backscattered electronsretain a substantial fraction of the incident energy. It is inevitablethat some of those electrons will be scattered in the directionof the detector. The beryllium window with a typical thicknessof 7.6 &#181;m (0.3 mil) is capable of stopping electrons withan energy below about 25 keV. Above energies of 25 keV, electronswill begin to penetrate the window and activate the detector,although with a loss of energy due to inelastic scattering inthe beryllium. When higher-energy (&gt; 25 keV) beams are employed,the electrons that enter the detector can have a substantial effecton the background. An example is shown in the following figurefor a 40-keV beam incident on arsenic. The background below 20keV is greatly distorted by the electron contribution added tothe expected x-ray continuum shown by the solid curve. Above 25keV, the background is mostly due to the normal x-ray continuum;virtually no electrons are able to penetrate the beryllium windowand retain energies in this range. Note that the analyst usuallyexamines the region between 0 and 10 keV or 0 and 20 keV. In theexample of the following figure, it may not be obvious that thebackground is anomalous unless the entire spectrum is examined.<P>Artifacts arising from scattered electrons entering the detectorcan be eliminated with magnetic shielding in front of the detectorsnout. In the windowless or thin window variety of Si(Li) spectrometers,such shielding is an absolute necessity. The artifact may becomemore pronounced for samples with a high atomic number or withsurfaces highly tilted relative to the beam. These two conditionswill produce the greatest number of high-energy backscatteredelectrons. Light element targets that are flat produce a relativelyminor effect. Operation with an acceleration voltage below 20kV will also minimize the effect.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/As_BG-1.gif HEIGHT=282 Width=360> <P>Figure 1. EDS spectrum of arsenic excited by a 40-keV electron beam showingan anomalous background below 25 keV due to direct entry of electronsscattered from the specimen into the detector. The x-ray continuumwas generated, then scaled using channels from the high-energyend of the spectrum.<P><a href="#top">Top</a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A> <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CS2"> Quantitative ZAF Analysis</A></H2><P>The following is an example of a quantitative analysis of a coppergold specimen using pure copper and pure gold as standards. Thebeam voltage is 20.5 keV. The required information has all beenentered into the Experiment Header and the Specimen Header. Forstandards, the compositions must be entered in the compositionwindow of the Spectrum Header.<P><H3 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="STD">Standardization Procedure</A></H3><P>Set-up a ROI for the CuKa peak as shown in Figure 1.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Cu_ROI-1.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640> <P>Figure 1.<P>Set-up a Simplex Fitting procedure for CuKa and do the fit. Theresults are shown in Figure 2.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Simp_Fit_Cu-2.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640> <P>Figure 2.<P>Select &quot;Make ZAF Standards&quot; under the Analysis Menuas shown in Figure 3.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Make_Std_Menu-3.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640> <P>Figure 3.<P>This opens the dialog box shown in Figure 4. Select &quot;RunZAF on Work Fit-Results&quot;.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Stds_Dial-4.gif HEIGHT=252 Width=361><P>Figure 4.<P>The box shown in Figure 5 will appear if the &quot;This is a Standard&quot; checkbox is not checked in the Spectrum Header. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Analy_Err-5.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 5.<P>If the analysis is allowed to continue, the standard results aredisplayed as in Figure 6.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Cu_Std_Res-6.gif HEIGHT=100 Width=505><P>Figure 6.<P>If the results are acceptable, they must be stored in a File ofStandards. You may either create a new file (see Figure 7) oropen an old file by selecting the appropriate button shown inFigure 4. You MUST then Add the Standard to the File (see Figure4). Once open, it is not necessary to reopen the file of standardsto add subsequent standards to the file - simply &quot;Add theStandard to the File&quot;.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Sav_Std_Dial-7.gif HEIGHT=271 Width=438><P>Figure 7.<P>Repeat the process for the pure gold standard (see Figure 8).Fill in the headers, Set-up the fitting procedure and fit theAuL peaks.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/AuL_Fit-8.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 8.<P>Run the ZAF on the spectrum as in Figures 4, 5 and 6. The resultsare again displayed as shown in Figure 9.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Au_Std_Res-9.gif HEIGHT=96 Width=502><P>Figure 9. <P>Then simply &quot;Add standard to the file&quot; (see Figure 10).This will add the standard to the file previously opened.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Stds_Dial-10.gif HEIGHT=254 Width=362><P>Figure 10.<P>   This completes the standardization process for this analysis.More standards may be added to this file at any time.<P><a href="#top">Top</a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H3 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="UNK">Unknown Procedure</A></H3><P>   The spectrum of the unknown may then be read into the WORKSpectrum and ROIs selected for the two peaks (see Figure 11).These ROIs should include the same peaks as were measured on thestandards, although they do not need to be exactly the same sinceall calculations are done on a per channel basis. Then set-upthe Simplex fitting for both the Cu K and Au L x-ray peaks.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Sel_ROI_AuCu-11.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 11.<P>   ZAF is then selected from the Analysis Menu as shown in Figure12.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Set_up_ZAF_Menu-12.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 12.<P>   The Main ZAF Quantitation window (see Figure 13) should nowbe on the screen. You may choose to normalize or not normalizeyour results. If you have saved a Set-up of a similar analysis,you may use that Set-up file, otherwise, select &quot;Set-up anAnalysis&quot;. You may also elect to quantitate an already fitted spectrum by selecting &quot;Old Fit File&quot;. If you do this, select the &quot;Old Fit File&quot;as the last operation before closing the window.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/ZAF_Quan_D-13.gif HEIGHT=336 Width=600><P>Fugure 13.<P>   The &quot;Select Standard&quot; window opens (bottom of Figure14). Select the &quot;Open File&quot; button and select the fileof standards you wish to use from the dialog box. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Opn_Std_D-14.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 14.<P>   Selecting the copper standard in the lower part of Figure 15displays the elements and lines stored for that standard. Sincethe standard was pure copper, only the CuKa1 line appears in thewindow. Click the check box for copper followed by &quot;Done&quot;from the upper window. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Sel_Cu_Std-15.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 15. <P>Repeat the operation for the gold standard.<P>   When standards for all analyzed lines have been selected, clickthe &quot;Done&quot; button in the lower window of Figure 15.This will bring up the &quot;Unanalyzed Element&quot; window shownin Figure 16. One unanalyzed element may be selected here if necessary.Since the example has measurements for both elements in the specimen,leave the &quot;No&quot; button clicked and click &quot;OK&quot;.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Unanal_Ele_D-16.gif HEIGHT=308 Width=422><P>Figure 16.<P>   This completes the ZAF analysis Set-up. Figure 13 should againbe on the screen. Before leaving this window, you may save theanalysis Set-up if you will be using it again at a later time.Also, a file of the ZAF results together with the correction factorsused may be saved by clicking the &quot;Full ZAF Report File?&quot;button. Clicking the &quot;Accept&quot; button signals the programto run the ZAF analysis at the conclusion of each fit of a spectrum.<P>With an unknown spectrum in WORK and the ROIs set for the peaksto be fit, click &quot;Do a Fit&quot;. The spectrum is fittedas shown in Figure 17, and after a slight pause, the analysisis complete.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Fit_Unk-17.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>Figure 17.<P>   The &quot;Add Fit&quot; button adds the fitting data and theconcentration to the results file. If a spreadsheet file has alsobeen requested, the compositions are also included in that file.To see the results file, click &quot;See Fit&quot; and the resultswill be displayed as shown in Figure 18.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/SeeFit-18.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P> Figure 18.<P>If a file of spectra is to be processed, this will all be doneautomatically and the results can be viewed at the end of thecalculations.<P>The ZAF procedure may also write an output file containing allthe correction factors as well as the results. This file can beexamined after exiting the DTSA program (see Figure 19). <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/ZAF_Res-19.gif HEIGHT=178 Width=434><P>Figure 19.<P><a href="#top">Top</a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
