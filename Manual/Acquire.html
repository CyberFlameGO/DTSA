If you have the board, put the SpectralEngine plug-in furnishedwith the board into the plug-ins folder that is in the folderwith DTSA. The one plug-in will handle all the boards installedin your computer.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/acquire_menu.gif HEIGHT=230 Width=157><P>This version of the program supports multiple boards, therefore,multiple spectra may be simultaneously collected. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AD"> Assign Display(s) </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/as_display.gif HEIGHT=127 Width=324><P>This allows the user to assign a display for each board in use.It is no longer necessary to acquire spectra only into the WorkDisplay.
