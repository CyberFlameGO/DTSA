This calibration is in additionto the eV/Channel value that you have entered in the <A HREF="Headers.html#EH"> EXPERIMENT HEADER </a>  and is intended only to fine tune DTSA. Coarse calibrationof both eV/Channel and offset can be done when the spectra areimported.<P>    It is necessary that at least one spectrum in the group havetwo peaks that are well separated in energy with good countingstatistics. The Calibrate dialog has several predefined possibilities,pure Cu, Al-Fe, Si-Fe and Al-Cu and one where the user may chooseany two peaks. To use these buttons, it is necessary to have inWORK the appropriate spectrum. Calibration will occur automaticallywhen the button is pushed. A least squares procedure is used todo the centroid determination of each peak. It is important, whenusing these predefined buttons, that the spectrum to which thecalibration is being applied, not be more than about 100 eV fromthe true value for any peak in the spectrum or the Least squaresmay fail to lock on to the peak. <P>When the predefined buttons are used, it is not necessary to entervalues in the four boxes at the bottom, as this will be done automatically.<P>    It is possible to use pairs of peaks other than the predefinedones. To use other pairs, select the Pick Lines button. The periodictable appears allowing the user to select any K, L, or M line.Alternatively, run <A href="#SI"> SIMPLEX </a> procedure manually for each peakin the pair before invoking this dialog, and then fill in thefour boxes with the requested information. You will find the book energies in the <A href="Math.html#XD"> X Ray Database </a>under the Math Menu.<P>    The three radio buttons on the right will select which calibrationdata to use and the Active Slope and Active Intercept show thevalues for the selection. The calibration may either be off (slope= 1, intercept = 0), or on with the data from the boxes at theleft or with the values stored with the spectrum. Good calibrationdata may be stored in the DTSA file by clicking &quot;Calibrationvalues to Work&quot;. As you switch from one radio button to another,the peak markers on the screen are moved to agree with the selectedcalibration values.<P>    The CALIBRATE feature was not intended to make large corrections.It will &quot;correct&quot; the calibration if either or bothof the  high and low energy peaks are no more than a quarter ofa peak width away from where they should be. The closer the mechanicalcalibration is then the less work the calibration feature willhave to do and the more meaningful will be the eV per channelvalue. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SQ"> MLLSQ multiple linear least squares </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/MLLSQ_D.gif HEIGHT=364 Width=383> <P>    Multiple Linear Least Squares (MLLSQ) is a curve fitting procedurethat determines the counts in families of characteristic linesin a spectrum by scaling reference distributions to the data.In the DTSA program these reference distributions or Referencesare usually obtained from well-characterized acquired spectrawith very good statistics that have been background subtracted.A Reference extends over an energy range from the low side tothe high side of a complete family of characteristic lines. Seethe section <A href="Files.html#MR">MLLSQ References </a>  for information on making, saving and manipulating references. You will need a Reference for eachfamily of lines you wish to measure, and for any family that hasa line that overlaps a family you wish to measure.  The actualfitting region for a bundle of lines is defined by the lowestand highest energies among the references required for fittingthe bundle.  Along with the family area and fitting standard deviation,the ratio of family peak area to 10 eV of background at the knownenergy of the major line in the family, and the ratio of familypeak area to a chosen region of peak-free background are reported. If no chosen region of background is selected in the Set-up,the integrated background counts in the energy range 1.35 to 1.45 keV are used in the ratio. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="MF"> Setting up MLLSQ Fitting </A></H2><P>I.

After running a Simplex fitting procedure,to re-activate the MLLSQ fitting procedure, click &quot;MLLSQ&quot;and then click &quot;OK&quot; in the MLLSQ dialog. Remember thatderivatives and output options may be changed at any time.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SI"> Simplex </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Simp_D.gif HEIGHT=351 Width=522> <P>Note the two buttons   &quot;Flow Chart&quot;   and   &quot;Help&quot;. These two buttonscontain most of the important information required to run theSIMPLEX, and will not be repeated here. The following are somegeneral comments on using the procedure.<P>    The Simplex procedure, like the MLLSQ procedure above, requiresthat you Set-up a Peak ROI (use the ROI button, main control window)that straddles the unresolved bundle(s) you wish to unravel, beforeentering the SIMPLEX dialog (or the auto-ROI inside the ChooseElements window may be used). If you are setting up to do a biologicalmicroanalysis, then also Set-up the &quot;Quant Background&quot;ROI at the desired position. The default value will be a narrowwindow centered at the energy of aluminum Ka, which is a goodplace for many types of biological analysis in an analytical electronmicroscope. <P>  As with any non-linear curve fitting procedure, it is very importantto start as close as is reasonable to the true answer set. Wehave automated this tedious aspect by providing automaticallythe amplitudes and energies. The width estimates are calculatedfrom your entry of detector resolution in the header of WORK.Experiment with different values of the resolution of the detectorand watch the effects on speed of convergence and accuracy offit as revealed by the residuals. The energy estimates we provideare, of course, the known energies of the x-ray lines. The Simplexprocedure is therefore, captive to how well you have calibratedyour spectrometer system. By this we mainly mean, how well doyou know the eV/channel. The spectrum can be relatively uncalibratedin terms of &quot;shift&quot;, i.e., the &quot;zero&quot; canbe somewhat wrong. The &quot;gain&quot;, i.e., eV/channel, however,must be known reasonably well, and that known value is &quot;valid&quot;in the <A HREF="Headers.html#SH">  SPECTRUM HEADER</a>. <P>  If you use the constraint option in the simplex dialog, thecloser you are to the true resolution the tighter you can makethe width constraints.<P>  If peaks are separated, fit them in separate windows. This pointcan not be over emphasized. Separated peaks are mathematicallyindependent and it is mathematically naive to add degrees of freedomto any fitting procedure when it is unnecessary. An exception to this exists for some L-peaks. If the L-beta peaks are overlapped so that the largest peak is a wide and distorted composite peak, then these peaks must be included with the L-alpha peaks, otherwise, the simplex will try to make this distorted peak into one peak with disastrous results.<P>  Use the &quot;Fit family peaks using linked areas&quot; mainlyfor K lines. This feature locks the peak areas together by theknown relative transition probabilities. It makes sense to dothis when there are few matrix effects such as for a thin specimenin an AEM, or a bulk specimen in an SEM if there are no absorptionedges from other elements under the peaks being unraveled. Whenwe get a good set of L and M relative transition probabilities,then this feature will work well for those cases too. <P>  When possible, include a number (a few) of channels of backgroundat either end of the fitting window. This will obviously improvethe relationship between the true background distribution andthe weighted fit to the residuals.<P>  _. (apple period) can be used to terminate a SIMPLEX fit andforce display of its current position in fitting space; however, all the fitting results will be lost. Applecomma will also stop the fit but preserve the data as far as thefit proceeded.<P>  During the fitting process, the up-down arrows on the extendedkeyboard will change the scale of the display. The response isa little sluggish since a lot of arithmetic is going on at thetime.<P>  The SIMPLEX procedure may also be used to determine accuratepeak areas for WDS applications. Certain (but not all) cases ofpeak overlap can be handled. Fortunately, peak overlap is rarein WDS. In later releases of DTSA, the WDS capability of the SIMPLEXwill be expanded considerably. In this version only a few basiccapabilities are provided, such as fitting with a combined Gaussian-Lorentzianpeak function.<P>  Putting too small a number in for Tolerance may cause the simplexto run for a very long time. Sometimes certain spectra will alsonot converge. Additionally, the simplex may be halted upon reachinga maximum number of iterations (positive integer &lt; 32768).<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DF"> Do a Fit </A></H2><P>This button will execute the curve fit operation chosenin one of the two buttons above it. Either the <A HREF="#SQ"> MLLSQ</A> (MultipleLinear Least Squares) procedure or the <A href="#SI"> SIMPLEX</A> procedure musthave been Set up. Both procedures will place the fit residuals(the result of subtracting the fitted peaks from the spectrum)in RESULTS and a weighted polynomial fit to the residuals in Spectrum1. The polynomial is between order 1-5 depending on the best c2fit. The polynomial is used to calculate the peak to local backgroundratio. The continuum used is always 10 eV at the peak centroid.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AF"> Add Fit </A></H2><P>This button will add the fit to any fit results filethe user chose when setting up the curve fit procedure.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SF"> See Fit </A></H2><P>This button permits the user to view the results of afit, either before or after an Add Fit. A scrollable text windowwill appear with all results from previous Add Fit operations.A known problem in this version of DTSA is that this window willonly hold 32,000 characters. If this value is exceeded, then only thefirst entries will be seen as the rest will be off the display buffer. The chosenresults files on disk, however, do not have a limit other thandisk space. This 32000 character limit will be removed in a laterrelease of the program.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CC"> Calculator </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Calc_D.gif HEIGHT=372 Width=639><P>    The Calculator dialog permits vector (spectrum) arithmeticto be performed. There are two columns, A and B that are the calculatoroperands. A third column, C, is the result. By use of a radiobutton in each of the three columns, it is possible to chooseone of the ten DTSA spectra for each column. The mathematical operator is chosenfrom the scrollable list. A single click on the operator willprovide more information. A double click will perform the operation.Not all operations require two operands in which case column Bis not used. Constants are entered into one or more of the textboxes.<P>    When a mathematical operation requires two operands, one mustbe careful which of the two spectrum headers is assigned to theresult spectrum. The first three items assist in making the rightassignment.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SW"> Save Work </A></H2><P>   This button will save the spectrum in WORK to the active fileof DTSA Spectra. If a file is not open for saving then the userwill be asked if one should be created. See also<A href="Files.html#SD">Save DTSA Spectrum to Disk</A>.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="PI"> Peak ID </A></H2>The Peak ID feature permits labeling the peaks observed in a spectrum.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/peakid.gif HEIGHT=125 Width=642><P>     These labels will use Greek notation if the Symbol fontsare installed in your system. The labels can be printed with thespectrum. The features are mostly self explanatory. By clickingas close as possible in the horizontal (energy) direction to themain a peak of a family, and to its height, a set of markers willbe placed on the display in the approximately correct positions.When using this feature, it is important that the spectrum becalibrated for both gain and shift. <P>    After the labels appear, it is possible to move them by placingthe mouse cursor over any one. As the cursor passes over the markerit will turn into a &quot;hand&quot; cursor. If you hold the mousebutton down you can move the marker up and down.<P>The &quot;Energy Lock the Labels&quot; check box, when unchecked, will permitthe labels to be moved left and right over a limited distance.<P>    The labels will follow the spectrum as it is expanded or contractedhorizontally but will not move with vertical expansions and contractionsof any kind.<P>    If you wish to change the size of the labels, use the &quot;LabelFont Size&quot; from the File Menu.<P>    The 1 Label/Family radio button will mark only the main apeak. This is useful for elements such as silicon with only oneobservable peak.<P>The Some Labels/Family is useful for most other peaks. <P>The All Labels/Family will label all peaks in a family and isprimarily intended to be used for WDS spectra as it will put up too many labels for most L and M peaks. <P>    The abbreviations &quot;esc&quot; and &quot;dbl&quot;, which will appear on the display,stand for escape peak and double energy peak, respectively.<P><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AP"> Auto Peak Label </A></H3>    Auto Peak Label will filter the spectrum with a special digitalfilter to locate any peaks and then attempt to identify them.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AO"> Auto Peak Options </A></H3><P>    &quot;Auto Peak Options&quot; allows the user to select an eV range foridentifying peaks and a sensitivity factor (how many times thestandard deviation of the background do you want a peak to bein order to be called a peak). The &quot; <A href="Analysis.html#FQ"> Qual a File of Spectra</A>&quot; in theAnalysis Menu will do a whole file of spectra and write the resultsto a spreadsheet file. The intensity number reported is the peakvalue from the digitally filtered spectrum. The digitally filteredspectrum may be examine by looking in Display 8. This is not the same digital filter that is used for background subtraction elsewhere in the program, but a version that enhances the ability to locate peaks.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="RI"> ROI (Regions-of-Interest)</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/roi.gif HEIGHT=124 Width=642><P>The ROI window permits marking a group of adjacent channels ina spectrum with an internal label that will permit DTSA to performcertain specialized operations. <P>The labeling procedure is accomplished by &quot;wiping&quot; themouse cursor, from left to right, across the desired part of thespectrum. A warning will occur if the user attempts to wipe fromright to left. <P>    After a given &quot;wipe&quot;, the chosen region will bemarked and the left and right channel numbers, and the integralcounts in this region, will be added to the display stack in themiddle of the ROI window. <P>    There are four types of ROI labels. <P>    The Scale ROI is used by the spectrum  <A href="#CC"> Calculator </a> to scaleone spectrum to another. See item 23 in the scrollable list inthe calculator.<P>The &quot;Peak Wipe&quot; is used by the curve fitting operations SIMPLEXand Multiple Linear Least Squares as an integral part of theirrespective Set-up operations. See the appropriate sections fordetails.<P>    The &quot;Quant Background&quot; (Quantitative Analysis Background ROI)is currently used only by the Hall Bio Quant quantitative analysisprocedure of DTSA. See <A href="Analysis.html#HB"> HALL Bio Analysis </A>  for details.<P> The &quot;Background Wipe&quot; is used by the Background Subtract item underthe Math Menu. See <A href="Math.html#BS">Background Subtract </a> for more details.<P>    The display stack in the middle of the ROI window is a &quot;sorting&quot;stack. As new items are added, they will move to the appropriatelocation in the list. Clearly, P stands for Peak and B standsfor Background. <P>    The &quot;Normalize (per Channel) &quot; check box will transform all theintegral counts in the window to a counts per one channel basis.This feature is useful for comparison purposes. Only this displayis affected. <P>    The &quot;Auto PEAK ROIs&quot; button brings up a periodic table windowthat allows the user to set peak ROIs by simply clicking on theelement (after determining if a K, L or M peak ROI is to be selected).Peak ROIs may also be set at any time from the keyboard. On anextended keyboard, holding down the keypad &quot;del&quot; keyand typing the element symbol will set an ROI for that elementsK peaks. Likewise, holding down the &quot;end&quot; key whiletyping the element symbol will set an ROI for the L peaks, andholding down the &quot;page down&quot; key while typing the elementwill set an ROI for the M peaks. To clear all peak ROIs, holddown the &quot;clear&quot; key on the number keypad and type the&quot;=&quot; key next to it.<P>    Putting the Mouse cursor on Work -&gt; and holding the buttondown allows the user to select which of the displays the numbersto the right refer to.

The height of the double energypeak is arbitrary and has no meaning. <P>    Note that the marker heights will change to the appropriatescale if &quot;Log&quot;, or &quot;Sqr Root&quot; are chosen for the display in the followingsection.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SC"> Spectrum Scaling Controls </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/scale.gif HEIGHT=125 Width=170><P>These controls are located in the bottom right of the main controlwindow and are responsible for both vertical and horizontal scalingof the main display window. All of these options affect only thedisplay and not the data in memory. <P>    If the Auto Scale is clicked twice, it will set that verticalscale expansion as the default. The vertical elevator bar willscale the spectrum between the factor of two available with thevertical arrow icons. The hatched part of the control has tentimes the effect as the arrow part of the control. The horizontalcontrols are the group of buttons and horizontal elevator barat the very bottom of the display. If the scale is differentiallyexpanded horizontally then this expanded scale can be moved leftand right with the elevator bar. The hatched part of the controlhas ten times the effect as the arrow part of the control. <P>    Clicking on the scale button which is highlighted (1K in thefigure) will automatically restore any differential expansionto the full range display for that scale. <P>    If Auto Scale is turned off, the vertical scale will be adjustedto a round number. Clicking the arrows up or down will changethe scale by a factor of two.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
