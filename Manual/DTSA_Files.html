To make intelligentuse of them and the program, descriptions of the files follow.<BR>Contents of Chapter. <BR><UL><LI><A HREF="#DT">DTSA Application</A> <LI><A HREF="#XD">XrayData</A><LI><A href="#PR">Preferences.MCA </A><LI><A href="#DR">DTSA Refs</A> <LI><A href="#DF">DTSA FIT</A><LI><A href="#DL">DTSA MLLSQ SET-UP </A><LI><A href="#CL">DTSA Cliff-Lorimer k-factors</A><LI><A href="#HS">DTSA Hall SET-UP</A><LI><A href="#OH">DTSA Hall OUTPUT</A><LI><A href="#ZD">DTSA ZAF Standards </A><LI><A href="#ZS">DTSA ZAF Set-up </A><LI><A href="#CD">DTSA Composition Database</A><LI><A href="#MS">DTSA Markers Set</A><LI><A href="#AP">DTSA Acquisition Plug-in</A><LI><A href="#PI">DTSA Foreign File Plug-ins</A><LI><A href="#DA">DTSA FILE Format</A><LI><A href="#QC">DTSA QC Setup</A></UL><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DT">DTSA</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/DTSA.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>The main application file is called DTSA and has an ICON whichis intended to look like a multi-channel analyzer.The program is started in the usual Macintosh way by rapidly doubleclicking on this ICON. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="XD">XrayData</A ></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/xraydata.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>All of the X-ray and other physical data are in a file calledXRayData.The spelling of the name is important, as is the location of thisfile. It must be in the same folder as DTSA and at the same &quot;level&quot;as DTSA; i.e., it must not be inside another folder in the DTSAfolder. The file is in a binary format and cannot be read by aword processor or a text editor.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="PR">Preferences.MCA</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/prefs.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Preferences MCA is a binary file of all the variables, settings,color schemes etc., used the last time the program was run. DTSA&quot;makes&quot; a file with this name every time you quit theprogram, overwriting the previous version. This file is read bythe program when it starts so that you are exactly where you werewhen you quit. One of the menu items, DTSA Setups, discussed later,allows you to name other &quot;DTSA Set-up&quot; files that mayeach be written for some purpose such as saving the settings fora particular electron column instrument. When instructed to readthis file DTSA reconfigures for this other purpose. CAUTION, ifyou have inadvertently gotten into trouble by attempting to learnabout a function by guessing, it is possible that some internaldamage to variables will occur. If you quit DTSA after such aknowledge quest, then all of the damage will be remembered foryour next use of the program. In such a case it is advisable tothrow the Preferences.MCA file in the trash and start over. Donot use an old Preferences MCA file with version 2.5 of DTSA asit will crash. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DR">DTSA Refs</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/refs.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon DTSA REFS are sets of reference distributions(references) used in the linear-least-squares (MLLSQ) curve fittingprocedure.A stored reference ideally extends over an energy region justbig enough to encompass one x-ray family. The background in thisregion must have been removed from the source spectrum beforethe reference was obtained. <A href="Math.html#BS"> Background Subtract </a>for procedures toaccomplish background subtraction and <A href="Files.html#MR"> MLLSQ References </a> for more information about saving and manipulating references.A common error is to confuse &quot;references&quot; with &quot;standards&quot;.References are peak profiles, or shapes, which represent the detectorresponse to a family of x-ray lines. They are used in the MLLSQfitting procedure to determine the area of an x-ray family. Standardsare obtained from specimens with known compositions. It is theratio of the family area from the &quot;unknown&quot; to thatof a &quot;standard&quot; that permits the conversion of the fittedarea into the concentration of an element.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DF">DTSA FIT</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/fit.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon DTSA FIT result from curve fitting oneor more spectra. Both the SIMPLEX and the MLLSQ procedures create such binary files.If you do not supply a name for the file, a default name is assigned.The particular name will depend on which curve fitting procedureyou are using and whether you are fitting spectra &quot;one ata time&quot; or are &quot;batch processing&quot; a large numberof spectra. The FIT file contains a complete record of the experimentalconditions and fitting information for each spectrum. This binaryfile is used by DTSA to create &quot;Spreadsheets&quot; for Excel&#169;,Kaleidagraph&#169; and Statview&#169;. Any other spreadsheet programthat supports TAB delimiting will be able to read these ASCIIfiles. A Microsoft Word&#169; TEXT document of the fit file informationcan also be created. Since the file is of type &quot;TEXT&quot;it can be opened by any word processor. The text file and spreadsheets can be written as soon as the fit file is completed orany time later. New York font at size 9 is recommended for thedisplay and printing conditions.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DL">DTSA MLLSQ SET-UP</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/lsqsetup.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon DTSA MLLSQ SET-UP contain all of the informationneeded to rapidly set-up a particular MLLSQ fitting operation.An MLLSQ Set-up file can be written anytime after a set of fittingdata is accepted from the MLLSQ Set-up dialog. There are similarSet-up Files for Simplex fitting and for quantitative analysis.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CL">DTSA Cliff-Lorimer k-factors</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/CLkfac.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon CL K's are files of k-factors for theCliff-Lorimer quantitation method. They are created and may be examined using the Cliff-Lorimer menuitem under the Analysis Menu.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="HS">DTSA Hall SET-UP</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/hallsetup.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon DTSA HALL SET-UP contain all of the informationneeded to rapidly set-up a particular Hall quantitation.A Hall Set-up file can be written from the Hall Set-up dialogor an old Set-up file may be called from the same dialog. <P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="OH">DTSA Hall OUTPUT</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/halloutp.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have the icon DTSA HALL OUTPUT contain all of the resultsof a Hall quantitation. A Hall Output file is written at the conclusion of a Hall quantitation.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="ZD">DTSA ZAF Standards</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/zafstd.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have this icon contain standards data for ZAF quantitative analysis. Both the ZAF procedure and the CITZAF procedures make and use the same standards files; therefore, once standards have been made by either procedure, they may be used by either procedure for a quantitative analysis. These standards should NOT be confused with the reference files used by the MLLSQ procedure - those are peak shape references only and are NOT ZAF standards.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="ZS">DTSA ZAF Set-up</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/zafsetup.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Particular set-ups for ZAF analyses may be saved after doing a ZAF set-up and have this icon.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CD">DTSA Composition Database</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/Compbase.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>This file has no default name. Files that have this icon may becreated by the user to save compositions of often used standardsThese files are created or accessed from the Spectrum Header Window,The Background Subtract Window or the Generate Windows. This fileis not associated with any spectrum. It contains only composition,valences and density of standard materials as entered by the userand the descriptive Headers.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="MS">DTSA Markers Set</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/labels.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files with this icon are used to save sets of peak labels so theymay be recalled later.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="AP">DTSA Acquisition Plug-in</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/acquplug.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have this icon with the name &quot;SpectralEngine&quot;interface DTSA with the 4pi, Inc. spectral engine board if installed.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="PI">DTSA Foreign File Read &amp; Write Plug-ins</A></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/readplug.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32><IMG SRC=../images/writeplug.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>Files that have these icons are used to import or export spectrumdata files of different formats. Place the ones you need in the&quot;Plug-ins&quot; folder inside the folder with DTSA. Storethe others in another folder. When DTSA is started, the file readingplug-ins (blue) are loaded into the <A HREF="Files.html#IX">Import File Menu</A> and the filewriting plug-ins (green) are loaded into the <A HREF="Files.html#IX">Export File Menu</A>.Selecting one from the Menu will allow you to read or write afile of that format.Since these are separate from the main DTSA program, new plug-insmay be written and added at any time without the necessity ofcreating a new DTSA program. It is only necessary to put the newplug-in into the &quot;plug-ins&quot; folder to make it availablefor use.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="DA">DTSA FILE Format</a></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/DTSA.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>    Files that have the icon &quot;DTSA File&quot; are the filesin which spectrum histograms and descriptive information are stored.A DTSA File is essentially a laboratory notebook of spectrumdata. A  DTSA File can contain one or as many spectra as you haveroom for on your disk. In the context of the DTSA, a spectrumis more than the histogram of counts versus energy increment.This histogram has very little meaning unless we know the experimentalconditions for acquisition. This experimental information is storedin the DTSA File in structures of data called headers; the headersare inseparable from the histograms they describe. DTSA uses twotypes of headers: the first is an &quot;Experiment Header&quot;which is written only once at the beginning of each DTSA fileof spectra. This header contains information that is common toall the spectra in the file, such as the beam energy, detectortake-off angle, analysts etc., Each spectrum histogram that followshas its own header, called a &quot;Spectrum Header&quot;. Thisheader contains information that may change from spectrum to spectrum,such as the beam current, the x, y coordinates, etc. DTSA makesit very easy to enter the information, which then cannot be &quot;misplaced&quot;as so often happens with the laboratory notebook, and to &quot;read&quot;or edit the header information.A DTSA file of spectra is illustrated graphically, in thefollowing figure: <P ALIGN=CENTER ><IMG SRC=../images/fileform.gif HEIGHT=207 Width=429><P>    See the Appendix for the DTSA <A href="APPENDIX.html#A1"> File Pascal structures</a>. Theheader structures list the data that are stored and are informativeeven if you are not familiar with the Pascal language.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="QC">QC Setup</a></H2><P><IMG SRC=../images/QC_setup.gif HEIGHT=32 Width=32>    Files that have the icon &quot;QC Setup&quot; are the files that arecreated by the Quality Control module when defining a quality control procedure.This is the file that is run each time a quality control spectrum has been selected.It only  contains the procedure that you define. All the data is saved in aspreadsheet. <P>Others<P>   There are some other files that may be generated by DTSA butat this time do not have special icons. These may be assignedlater in an update.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
