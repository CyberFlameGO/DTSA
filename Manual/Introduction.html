It was created for a number of reasons. The most important reason was the absence of a simple way to study the physical and statistical aspects of an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analytical problem other than actually preparing calibration standards and specimens, measuring spectra and analyzing them. DTSA will emulate the specimen properties and experimental environment to generate spectra reflecting the relevant physics, chemistry and statistics of a specimen under electron bombardment, thus permitting a rapid but detailed study of a potential analytical problem at the desktop. The analyst is able to determine an expected mean value, the variance about this mean, and an accurate estimate of the minimum detectable limit (MDL) for a given element in a given matrix on a particular instrument. <P>    DTSA permits the detailed analysis of a collection of acquired EDS or WDS spectra at one's desktop, freeing the expensive analytical electron column instrument and its associated x-ray analysis system for data acquisition.<P>    The program requires a minimum of 9 megabytes of memory in a Power Macintosh type computer with a color, or monochrome, monitor (The current program will work with 256 colors The new version of the DTSA program will not run on older Macintosh or PC computers. The program is System 7 or 8 compatible and will function in 32 bit mode. With an appropriate Nu-buss or PCI card installed in the computer, the program can also acquire x-ray spectra directly. <P>   DTSA is a fully functioning multichannel analyzer that performs all of the functions expected in a Multi-Channel Analyzer (MCA) plus much more. The program provides all of the usual scaling operations, peak markers and region-of-interest operations. The program has incorporated many of the accepted data analysis procedures developed over many years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), (formerly the National Bureau of Standards) in Gaithersburg, MD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD, as well as procedures such as CITZAF, Cliff-Lorimer, and the Hall method for biological analysis. <P>   NIST and NIH will use their best efforts to deliver a high quality program/database and to verify that the procedures and data contained therein have been selected on the basis of sound scientific judgment. However, NIST and NIH make no warranties to that effect, and shall not be liable for any damage that may result from errors or omissions in the program or the database. Furthermore, at several places in this documentation, and in the program itself, reference is made to commercial manufacturers of equipment. These references in no way are to be construed as a recommendation or an endorsement. <P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><a name="FE"></a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Features of DTSA</H2>	<UL><LI> Many commercial multi-channel analyzer data formats (both binary and ASCII) can be read directly into the program without modification.<LI> Extensive K-shell, L-shell, and M-shell (KLM) markers: EDS includes escape, double and all observable lines-edges. Wavelength dispersive x-ray spectrometry (WDS) includes high order reflections and satellite (spark) lines due to multiple ionization.<LI> A qualitative analysis tool progressively subtracts away a calculated, or reference, set of peaks of one element from a peak bundle due to more than one element. This quickly permits finding those "little" peaks hidden beneath large peaks.<LI> Automatic calibration. <LI> Peak labeling with Siegbahn notation. LaserWriter fully supported for graphical output of fully labeled spectra.<LI> Automatic qualitative analysis of x-ray spectra.<LI> Elaborate file structures consisting of headers and multiple spectra per file. All relevant analytical information is stored in the headers, limited only by disk storage. <LI> Extensive use of "batch processing" supported for curve fitting, quantitation, printing, etc. Output is directly into several of the more popular "spreadsheet" formats such as Excel©, Kaleidagraph© and Statview© permitting these extraordinarily powerful statistical and plotting programs to be used intimately with the quantitative or qualitative output of DTSA.<LI> Ten, 8192 channel, real-valued spectral displays under complete operator control.<LI> Extensive spectral "calculator" containing all relevant mathematical operators.<LI> Extensive "tutorial" features include: All relevant physical and mathematical operations can be independently plotted. Spectra as seen inside the specimen, inside the detector, etc., can be generated and plotted. This feature is very powerful for training new users.<LI> Built in "HELP" for all critical functions. The help messages are presented as text windows and in many cases as complete "FLOW CHARTS" available by activating a button at the location where the help is most likely to be required.<LI> Conversion of WDS spectra into units of energy for direct comparison with EDS spectra. The same mathematical procedures can then be applied to both.<LI> Both linear and non-linear curve fitting procedures to extract peak intensities with a minimum of operator input. Background removal is completely automatic (or manual if desired).<LI> Full suite of quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis	options for converting the peak intensities into chemical values.	<LI> A quality control procedure for monitoring EDS detectors over time has been included.</UL><P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><a name="QN"></a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Quantitative Analysis</H2>Routes DTSA provides for quantitative analysis:<H3>I. Peak measurement:</H3><P>	 A. Multiple linear least squares (<A HREF="Main_Control.html#SQ"> MLLSQ</A>) procedure is extremely fast and accurate but requires reference spectra and finds only peak intensities. Background is automatically suppressed by a digital filter. Derivative  references compensate for small energy calibration and peak width differences between data and references.<P>	B. <A href="Main_Control.html#SI">Sequential Simplex</a> is a non-linear search procedure that determines values for peak intensity, width and position.  It does not require reference spectra and is easier to set-up but slower than MLLSQ. Background automatically suppressed by a digital filter.<H3>II.

These other control windows are activated by the group of buttons on the left side of the Main Control Window and by selections from the Menu Bar. Up to 10 overlaid spectrum count histograms can  be plotted in the Spectrum Display Window.  These plots are called WORK, RESULTS and 1 through 8.  Spectra can be readily moved among all the plots. All program functions operate on the spectrum in WORK;  the results, if any, of a procedure applied to WORK are plotted in RESULTS and other necessary locations. <P>   The remainder of this manual discusses each of the menu items that can be accessed from the Menu Bar, the buttons, and other controls in the Main Control Window, the files created by the program, and other features.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><a name="AC"></a><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Acknowledgments</H2><P>   DTSA is a very large computer program (300,000 lines of code) with a wealth of capabilities. Many of the capabilities are so obvious that they require little or no documentation. Other features are not obvious and will test our ability to describe them sensibly. Many of the capabilities are interdependent and intertwined which makes this task even more daunting. The various physical and mathematical processes that are coded into the program represent much of the cumulative knowledge on the subject of x-ray microanalysis gained by the authors and their colleagues at NIST and NIH over many years. Needless to say, we have borrowed heavily from other workers in this field and from the general literature. We are particularly indebted to (in alphabetical order): Brian Andrews, John Armstrong, Mary Carney, Paul Carpenter, Marty Carr, John Colby, Scott Davilla, Kurt Heinrich, David Joy, Janos Labar, Eric Lifshin, John Mansfield, Dale Newbury, Wayne Rasband, Fred Schamber, Walter Schroeder, Gerry Schumacher, Henry Schuman, Peter Statham, Larry Thomas and Scott Wight. <P>   A final, and probably our most important acknowledgment, must go to our several line managers who have been more than a little patient and generous during the long development of this program. These four are, at the NIH, Murray Eden and Henry Eden  and, at the NIST, Rance Velapoldi and Eric Steel. We are deeply grateful and appreciative.<P>    DTSA is an on-going project; upgrades of the program and this manual will occur as new capabilities are added. We welcome suggestions for improvements and plead for bug reports. </P></body><html>
