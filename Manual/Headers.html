It also servesthe purpose of creating valid and appropriate fields for a newdisk file. <P>    If there is an &quot;active&quot; file of DTSA spectra, the &quot;Edit  the EXPERIMENT Header&quot; in active FILE button will be functional,otherwise it is &quot;grayed out&quot; and is non-functional.This feature is for spectra being read by DTSA. It does not applyto the header of spectra being saved in which case, all the experimentheader data should be entered before the first spectrum is saved.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="DI"> EDS Detector Information </A></H2><P>    The Detector Information button brings up the following dialog if the EDS radiobutton is chosen:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/det_win.gif HEIGHT=385 Width=639> <P>    This dialog is invoked in several places in DTSA. Here thedialog is used for review-edit-append(ing) a disk file. In otherplaces in DTSA this dialog affects the actual generation of spectra.The quantities to the right of the text edit boxes on the leftside of the dialog are in two parts. The first part is the densityused by DTSA to do the Beer's law calculation for the variouswindow materials. The second quantity is the manufacturer's &quot;recommended&quot;value, and should be used as a starting point. Although, as justnoted, the dialog as used here does not actually result in a calculationdirectly.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="WI"> WDS Detector Information </A></H2><P> If the WDS radio button is chosen, the following DetectorInformation dialog is invoked:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/wds_det.gif HEIGHT=364 Width=633><P>    This dialog permits changing quantities unique to WDS spectra.The WDS capability of DTSA is installed in this version and thisdialog; however, processing WDS spectra is still experimental(particularly Simplex fitting) so the user needs to develop hisown procedures. The Digital Filter Multiplier changes the widthof the digital filter as it is often necessary to adjust thisfor different peak widths. The Hypermet number determines whatfraction of a peak is Gaussian and what part is Lorentzian (0for pure Lorentzian and 1 for pure Gaussian). For Simplex peakfitting, this fraction should be varied until the best fit isobtained. This is not a speedy process so patience is required.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="ED"> Detector-Instrument Geometry</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Det_Geom_Exp.gif HEIGHT=379 Width=623> <P>    This dialog is used in several places throughout the program.Here it is used in the experiment header, note that only Beta,Detector Elevation Angle and Azimuthal Angle can be changed. Theseare the parameters that are normally defined as instrument parametersand are fixed for an instrument. The other quantities are in theSpectrum Header and may be changed from spectrum to spectrum.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SH"> Spectrum Header</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/spec_head.gif HEIGHT=382 Width=641><P>    This dialog permits editing those quantities that may change,from spectrum to spectrum, in the disk file. This &quot;SpectrumHeader&quot; dialog, like the &quot;Experiment Header&quot; Dialog,above, serves the review and editing functions for an alreadycreated file. It also serves the purpose of creating valid andappropriate fields as a new disk file is being created, spectrumby spectrum. <P>    Starting from the top: The Experiment Title serves just asa reminder of which &quot;Experiment&quot; is currently active.<P>    The WORK Spectrum Number is the position in the disk fileof the current spectrum. If a file is being created then thisquantity is the spectrum number about to be appended to the diskfile. <P>    The Date field is the date and time to be review-edit-append(ed).The format is important and all entries must be occupied. It shouldbe noted that DTSA will &quot;fill in&quot; a date near the turnof the last century to indicate that either there was a problem,or that it found a null entry.<P>    The Spectrum Class column of text edit boxes, preceded byradio buttons, is a convenience feature for that class of analysiswhere the specimen consists of a number of distinct and namablephases, or some other distinct characteristic that can be labeled.By filling in the fields (which may be up to 50 characters) beforethe analysis proceeds (if an acquisition board is installed inthe computer) or before the disk file is created (if working froma collection of ASCII spectra)  it is then possible to merely&quot;click&quot; the appropriate radio button to attach thislabel to each spectrum being saved to the disk file. This savestyping the same things over and over. The class is also written to the spreadsheet output. The spectra may then be sorted by class by the spreadsheet program.<P>    The remaining text edit boxes and radio buttons are self explanatory.It should be noted that a number of fields and radio buttons arenot used by DTSA. The purpose of these fields and buttons is to&quot;pass through&quot; the information to other programs thatcan use the DTSA output files, such as spread sheet programs,text editors, or a ZAF quantitation program such as stand aloneCITZAF. The current and time fields are used by any of the DTSAquantitative analysis functions.<P>    The large text edit box is for the entry of the Spectrum LabelField. This field can contain up to 255 characters. It is notnecessary, or desirable, to include carriage returns since theentered text will automatically fold around as needed.<P>The 2 in-column check boxes and the Do Checked button at the bottomcenter are for editing an existing file on disk. In this versionof the program, if the Copy to Subsequent Headers feature is invoked,it will copy only the changed fields into ALL subsequent spectrumheaders. This applies to information that is in the sub-dialogsDetector Geometry and Composition Information.   Warning   Ifthe spectrum label is changed, the copy to subsequent headerswill copy the label to all headers.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="SG"> Detector-Specimen Geometry </A></H2><P> The Detector Geometry button will bring up the following sub-dialog:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Det_Geom_Spec.gif HEIGHT=383 Width=625><P>Note that the fields associated with the Experiment Header arenot changeable. Only the Specimen-Detector Distance, and the twoSpecimen Tilt Angles may be changed.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CI"> Composition Information</A></H2><P>Information Returning to the main Spectrum Header dialog, the CompositionInformation button will invoke the following dialog:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/spec_comp.gif HEIGHT=379 Width=637><P>    This dialog permits attaching up to 15 concentrations andvalences to a spectrum header. It is necessary to do this if thespectrum is to be made into a ZAF standard (in which case, theSpecimen is a Standard check-box should be checked). If the specimenis an unknown then these fields can be used to fix the concentrationsof selected elements if these concentrations are known beforehand.<P>    If a ZAF or standardless ZAF analysis is not performed thenthese fields are available for general notebook purposes, andit is not necessary to fill them in. <P>    The Database part of this window operates in the same fashionas in the Generate Menu item discussed above.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
