In addition, the user can plot most of the physics functions that are used in quantitative analysis as well as x-ray spectra for each step from generation inside the specimen to detection inside the detector. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/gen_menu.gif HEIGHT=159 Width=281><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="PM">Peaks Manually</A></H2>    Peaks Manually permits the generation of from one to ten Gaussiancurves (peaks). It is possible to control the three parametersindividually (width, position and height) for each peak. If zerowidth is entered, DTSA will determine the appropriate width ofeach peak based on the entry of your detector resolution at theenergy of Mn Ka in the work experiment header. If you have changedpeak widths, you may set the width back to the detector resolutionby clicking the &quot;Reset to MnK width&quot; button.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Pk_Man_D.gif HEIGHT=334 Width=463><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="NS"> Make File of n Noise Spectra </A></H2><P>   Make File of n Noise Spectra. This feature enables creationof a file of n Spectra each containing different Poiss&oacute;nnoise (the counting noise observed in EDS spectra). It allowsa Monte Carlo simulation of n spectra, each taken under similarconditions to determine detectability levels and variance. 'Generate'the desired spectrum, bulk or thin, put the resulting spectrumin 'Work' and then do this dialog.  When the calculations finish(which can take several minutes for 50 spectra), 'curve fit' thespectra in auto mode and send the results to a spread sheet filefor statistical analysis. See <A href="APPENDIX.html#A4"> Appendix IV</a> for a detailed discussion of this feature.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="TS"> Thin Target Spectrum / Bulk Target Spectrum </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/thin_gen.gif HEIGHT=385 Width=640><P>    An X-ray spectrum is generated from first principles for eithera thin target (e.g., a specimen in a transmission electron microscope)or a thick target (e.g., a specimen in a scanning electron microscopethick enough to be opaque to the impinging electron beam). ALLinstrumental and physical parameters must be meaningful and specified.<P>    Enter the elemental concentration for all elements present.Enter the concentrations designating format from the options allowedto the top-right of the list. The program will convert to weightfraction before leaving the dialog. If you enter oxides using the &quot;Ox. Wt. Fr.&quot; format, (e.g. Al2O3), the program automatically enters the compositions of Al and O as well as their valences. Above the bottom are threelines that show the current sum, 1-sum, and the average atomicnumber of the hypothetical specimen. Before converting eitherway between atomic or weight concentration, the sum must be essentially1 or conversion errors can result.  <P>   Enter the kilovoltage, the time and the Faraday current.  Ifthe specimen is &quot;thin&quot; then the thickness and the densityboxes become active. Obviously, we need to know how many atomsthe beam interacts with, so both density and thickness are requiredfor thin targets. Neither of these quantities are required forthick targets because the mass range is accurately predicted byan analytical formula.<P>   Database controls are provided. If more than a few elementsand their concentrations are entered, it is possible to placethese into a database to prevent having to type them in again.&quot;Load a Database&quot; will allow you to open a previouslycreated composition database and &quot;Make a DataBase&quot; opensa file for you to add compositions to (compositions may be addedor removed from files opened either way). Before entering a compositionmanually in the columns at the left, it is a good idea to clickthe &quot;Zero All&quot; button to clear out the previous data.Data may become confused if some numbers are changed and the totalsbecome ridiculous (even temporarily).<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="SO">Select Outputs</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Sel_Out_D.gif HEIGHT=385 Width=640><P>This dialog permits use of any or all of the ten spectral displaysto plot out most of the physical and mathematical quantities usedby DTSA. The choices are in a scrollable window and clicking onceon any item will cause a brief description of the choice to appearat the top of the dialog window. The most important item is thefinal composite spectrum without counting noise, item 100. Thisis the spectrum with no counting noise present and will alwaysbe written into WORK. To add the correct amount of noise to thisspectrum go to the MATH menu and <A href="Math.html#AP"> &quot;Add Poiss&oacute;n Noise&quot;</A>.This will add the correct noise for the Faraday current, time,detector area etc. that you specified in the previous menu (puttingthe result of this operation into RESULTS).  <P>Some of the options are plotted versus atomic number - these optionshave nothing to do with the composition entered in the &quot;Generate&quot;window. There are also some options that are a function of thebeam overvoltage (U) - these are valid for only ONE element.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="PP"> Pick Your Physics </A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Pic_Phys_D.gif HEIGHT=381 Width=640><P>Choose from a variety of x-ray cross sections, all from the currentliterature or cited in current literature. In general, the usershould not use other than the default settings. <P>However, for those users who desire to obtain the most accurateanswers using the &quot;standardless&quot; analysis ZAF procedure,it is possible to &quot;fine tune&quot; the cross section multiplierScaling Factors for a particular SEM/Microprobe configuration.The K multiplier can probably be left at 1.00, but the valuesfor L and M can be changed to produce better standardless answers.If it is required to deviate significantly from 1.00 then somethingelse is probably at fault.<P>    To experiment with these numbers, place actual spectra, takenunder known conditions and containing various mixes of K, L andM x-ray families, in the scratch spectra (1-8), and then try togenerate the same spectra. The default continuum cross sectionsfor both the &quot;bulk&quot; and &quot;thin&quot; cases are quiteaccurate. If the magnitude of the generated continuum is differentthan that from the real spectra, then one or more instrument parametersare probably not what you think they are. The most likely candidatesare the distance from the specimen to the detector, or the Faradaycurrent.<P>    For Detector Parameters, See Experiment Header in Headersmenu.<P>There are two radio buttons, EDS and WDS that will control theshape and width of the generated x-ray lines. For a discussionof the underlying theory see <A href="APPENDIX.html#A5">Appendix V</a>.<P>    Last Generated into work Spectrum  brings the last spectrumgenerated and puts it into WORK. This feature is useful when aseries of mathematical operations have been performed and theoriginal generated spectrum was inadvertently erased.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A></BODY></HTML>
